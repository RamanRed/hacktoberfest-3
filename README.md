# User Authentication System

## Overview
This project implements a **user authentication system** using **Node.js** with **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Passport.js**. The main goal is to provide a secure way for users to register, log in, and access protected routes within a web application. Users can create an account, log in with their credentials, and log out safely.

---

## Key Features
- **User Registration**: Users can register with hashed passwords.
- **User Login**: Secure authentication for users to log in with their credentials.
- **Session Management**: Maintains user sessions to keep users logged in.
- **Protected Routes**: Access to specific routes is restricted to authenticated users only.

---

## Guidance for Students

When working on your solution, keep the following concepts in mind:

### Understanding User Authentication
- Learn the concepts of **authentication** (verifying identity) and **authorization** (granting access).
- Understand how these are applied in web applications.

### Database Design
- Design a `users` table in your **PostgreSQL** database to securely store user information.
- Include necessary fields for **registration** and **authentication**.

### Password Security
- Hash passwords using a reliable library like **bcrypt**.
- Consider how to handle **password recovery** if a user forgets their password.

### Session Management
- Learn how session management works in **Express**.
- Implement strategies to protect against **session hijacking**.

### Input Validation and Error Handling
- Implement input validation to enhance security.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent **SQL injection** and other attacks.
- Handle and log errors gracefully.

### User Experience
- Focus on improving user experience by providing clear messages for:
  - Successful registration
  - Failed logins
  - Other notifications

### Security Best Practices
- Research common vulnerabilities like **XSS** and **CSRF**.
- Implement measures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- Follow best practices in coding and data management.

### Testing
- Plan to test your application to ensure:
  - **User registration**, **login**, and **session management** function correctly.

## Getting Started

### To set up the project:

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RamanRed/hacktoberfest-3.git
   cd user-authentication-system
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a PostgreSQL database** and set the environment variables in a `.env` file. Use the following format:

   ```makefile
   PG_USER=yourusername
   PG_HOST=localhost
   PG_DATABASE=yourdatabase
   PG_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   PG_PORT=5432
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret
   ```

4. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
