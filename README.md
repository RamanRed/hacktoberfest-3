User Authentication System
Overview
This project implements a user authentication system using Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, and Passport.js. The main goal is to provide a secure way for users to register, log in, and access protected routes within a web application. Users can create an account, log in with their credentials, and log out safely.

Key Features
User registration with hashed passwords.
User login with authentication.
Session management to keep users logged in.
Protected routes that require authentication to access.
Guidance for Students
When working on your solution, keep the following concepts in mind:

Understanding User Authentication:

Familiarize yourself with the concepts of authentication and authorization. Know the difference between the two and how they apply to web applications.
Database Design:

Think about how to structure your database. You’ll need a users table to store user information securely, so plan the fields required for registration and authentication.
Password Security:

Understand the importance of hashing passwords. Use a reliable library like bcrypt to ensure passwords are stored securely. Consider what happens if a user forgets their password and how to handle it.
Session Management:

Learn how session management works in Express. Consider how you will keep track of user sessions and what strategies you’ll implement to protect against session hijacking.
Input Validation and Error Handling:

Implement proper input validation to enhance security. Ensure that user inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other attacks. Also, think about how you will handle and log errors gracefully.
User Experience:

Consider how the user experience can be improved. This includes clear messages for successful registration, failed logins, and other notifications that guide users through their journey.
Security Best Practices:

Research common security vulnerabilities (like XSS and CSRF) and how to mitigate them in your application. Make sure you are following best practices in coding and data management.
Testing:

Plan for testing your application. Consider how you will test user registration, login, and session management to ensure everything works as expected.
Getting Started
To set up the project:

Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Create a PostgreSQL database and set the environment variables in a .env file.
Start the server with node app.js.
Explore the application by registering a new user and logging in to see how the authentication system works!
